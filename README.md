# Raw samples metadata information
1. Clean_md5_2917.csv

    This file have filename,MD5 hash and size for all clean samples (2917) collected for experiment.

2. Malware_md5_2917.csv    

    This file have filename,MD5 hash and size for all malware samples (2917) collected for experiment.

3. Clean_md5_without_dup_2873.csv
     This file have filename,MD5 hash and size without any duplicate clean samples (2873).

4. Malware_md5_without_dup_2873.csv   

     This file have filename,MD5 hash and size without any duplicate clean samples (2873).
5. Malware-2722_hash_size_entropy.csv  

    This file have filename (Hash) , filesize in bytes, and Entropy of each malware sample a Total of 2722.

6. Clean-2501_name_size_entropy.csv  

    This file have filename, filesize in bytes, and Entropy of each clean sample, which where collected after fresh installed Windows OS (XP and Windows7) a Total of 2501.

7. Clean_VT_report-2873.csv    
    This file have Virus Total report of all clean samples (without duplicate, 2873). File                contains information like, ID,fileName,MD5Hash,Total,Positive,Type-TrendMicro,Type-F-secure,Scan-Date.

8.  Clean_NOT_PE_6.txt  

      This file have list of clean files which are not Portable Executable (PE) file format.

9.  Malware_VT_report_without_Zipped_3817.csv  

    This file have Virus Total report of all malware samples (with some zipped that is not used in analysis, 3817). File contains information like,
    MD5hash,Total,Positive,TrendMicro,F-Secure,McAfee,Symantec,Avast,Kaspersky,BitDefender,Sophos,GData,Panda,Qihoo-360,Scan-Date



# Scripts files

1. move_duplicate_files.py
    This python script will move the duplicates files based on their MD5 and will give file information report as CSV file. ( Look into script header for detail working)

2. calculate_size_and_entropy.py

    This python script will calculate size and entropy of all files present in given directory and will write these information with file name to a .csv file.

3. benign-labeling.py
  This script will take a csv file with MD5 hash as input and it will read all MD5 and will fetch the VirusTotal report on each MD5 and after receiveing and parsing the report
   will write them to a CSV file path/report.csv.  The CSV file header will have fields as
    [ID,fileName,MD5hash,Total,Positive,type-TrendMicro,type-F-secure,Scan-Date]

4. get_all_md5.py       

    This is very simple script make use of python MD5 function to calculate MD5 hash of all files in given directory. filename and their MD5 written to a csv file to later use. This file can be use with benign-abeling.py script to get VirusTotal report.

5. get_PE_file_info.py  
    This script will give file information related to company and version.
    - File version
    - ProductVersion
    - ProductName
    - CompanyName
    - etc..
6. integrated_features_extraction.py    

    This is one of main file for creating dataset, it will extract integrated features of given samples. User have to supply malware and benign samples path in two different run and supplying the class label accordingly. Currently, user have to merge extracted   features manually for both classes to create overall dataset.

7. raw_features_extraction.py    

    This is another important script which extract all the values from all three main PE headers. DOS_Header, FILE_HEADER AND OPTIONAL_HEADER. If any exception happens  then the values will be assigned as zero for that header. Say, many PE files don't have DOS_Header then all the header will be assigned '0'.
