# Scripts files

1. move_duplicate_files.py
    This python script will move the duplicates files based on their MD5 and will give file information report as CSV file. ( Look into script header for detail working)

2. calculate_size_and_entropy.py

    This python script will calculate size and entropy of all files present in given directory and will write these information with file name to a .csv file.
